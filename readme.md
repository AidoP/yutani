# Yutani
A pure-Rust Wayland implementation.

## Stability
Note: Yutani is still in pre-`0.1.0` versions and as such breaking changes may be made often.

Yutani also depends on `syslib` for interfacing with Linux rather than `libc` which may be a stability and security concern for some.

## Usage

Yutani is not yet ready for use.

[yutani-codegen](https://github.com/AidoP/yutani-codegen) (and by extension, [wl-protocols](https://github.com/AidoP/wl-protocols)) will be needed if you want to generate dispatch glue / boilerplate.

## Examples

See [wayvk](https://github.com/AidoP/wayvk).
